                If you are one among those thinking for a transplant treatment,
                one of the questions that keeps bothering you is: What is the
                right age for hair transplant? It is one of the most important
                factors to be considered. While, the other factors such as the
                hair loss pattern, the overall health and the treatment
                expectations also impact the success of the transplant results.

                The reasons for causing a hair loss can be anything ranging
                from:
              </p>
              <ul className="lh-lg">
                <li>
                  <strong>Genetics</strong>– One of the most common causes of
                  development of male pattern baldness or severe female hair
                  thinning.
                </li>

                  <strong>Poor lifestyle</strong>– Poor nutrition habits if your
                  diet lacks necessary vitamins and minerals, it would hamper
                  the hair growth.

                  <strong>Stress</strong>– One of the most common factors for

                What is the right age for a hair transplant treatment?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Hair loss is a problem faced by almost everyone and is a
                long-lasting one. Now-a-days, young adults of just 20 years of
                age are experiencing severe hair fall leading to baldness in
                most of the cases. With the advancements in science &
                technology, all of you get to hear about transplant surgery
                being the right solution to restore hair naturally and
                permanently.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, one of the most common questions we get to hear is what
                is the right age to get a transplant treatment? The answer for
                this is not a definite one but it depends on various factors and
                according to few experts the following criteria determine the
                right age.
              </p>

              <img src={hairbaldbd} className="w-100 my-5" alt="" />

              <h6 className="text-black fw-medium mb-3 d-block">
                If you are someone aged 21 years or below
              </h6>
              <p>
                Doctors do not advise a transplant treatment at such a young age
                as the hair growth is not stabilized yet by this age and also
                the physiological factors such as the hormonal levels keep
                fluctuating.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In very rare cases such as in those with a loss of hair due to
                some major trauma or to cover the scars post trauma, transplant
                treatment is suggested in young age itself.
              </p>

              <h6 className="text-black fw-medium mb-3 d-block">
                If you are someone aged between 26-35 years
              </h6>
              <p>
                This is typically considered the right age, the golden age for
                the transplant treatment. The experts believe that hair loss is
                completely stabilized and donor hair is available in plenty. In
                this age patients will also have some realistic expectations
                from the transplant treatments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, other factors such as the overall health, any
                underlying medical and scalp conditions are to be thoroughly
                evaluated for, before planning a hair transplant treatment, as
                all these factors play a crucial role in determining the
                results.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                However, this is considered the right age for the transplant
                treatment as the patients are psychologically and financially
                well prepared for the treatments and any necessary follow-up’s.

                Experts are of the opinion that there is no upper age limit for
                the patients to undergo a hair transplant treatment. Factors
                such as good overall health, and the availability of sufficient
                donor hair is crucial to get the desired results from a
                transplant treatment.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Higher the age of the patient, longer is the time taken for the
                body cells to heal. However, statistics have shown the chances
                of recovery post- transplant is good even in those who have
                undergone the transplant in their 50’s (or) 60’s.

                Age is one of the most important factors while considering a
                transplant treatment for the following reasons: 
              </p>
              <ul className="lh-lg">
                <li>
                  <strong>Genetics</strong> – If you are some one aged less than
                  25 years, then the process of hair loss is on going and it
                  would be difficult to predict the future hair loss patterns
                  and to plan the treatment accordingly. Hair transplantation in
                  such early age could result in unnatural results, so it is
                  advisable to get it done once the hair growth is stabilized.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Psychological factors</strong> – Emotional factors
                  play a critical role in recovery from any medical treatment.
                  Elderly candidates provide you with a more realistic results
                  and help you understand the commitment required for the
                  aftercare precautions to be followed for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Early transplant risks</strong>– If you are undergoing
                  a transplant treatment at an early age, the hair loss or
                  growth patterns after it, would give you the unnatural
                  results. In some cases, it would also result in patchwork or
                  rework post-transplant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Worth waiting </strong>– It is important to wait for
                  the right time until the hair loss stabilizes, mainly to
                  ensure a predictable hair loss pattern and to allow for a
                  better treatment plan and get good, natural results.

                <li>The number of grafts required for treatment</li>
                <li>
                  The type of technique used. Treatments with more precision
                  usually incur more treatment cost.

                  Clinics with higher reputation would also charge more for the
                  treatments. But, we should always outweigh the costs in
                  respect to the results, especially when it comes to healthcare
                  related treatments.

                  The cost of the transplant treatment varies across different
                  clinics and those located in the metro cities usually charge a
                  higher price compared to those in the towns.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Age does not directly affect the hair transplant cost in
                India but younger patients with ongoing hair loss would require
                additional procedures or revision surgeries to get the best
                results. The cost of the treatment also varies based on the
                additional treatments involved such as the PRP (plasma rich
                therapy) or GFC (Growth factor concentrate) injections, as a
                part of the maintenance therapy. If you are someone whose hair
                loss has stabilized, you would not require any such revision
                surgeries and the treatment costs would also be lower.
